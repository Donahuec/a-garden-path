The taste of loneliness is the acrid smoke  
That drifts from the fires of the unknown.  
It lists lazily upwards and into the soul  
As the taste of ash is all that you'll know.


The sound of loneliness is the empty room  
That echoes the songs of what it never could do.  
The silence is thick as it presses in  
Not a sound to be heard, not a breath, not a word.


The smell of loneliness is the desert wind  
That burns the mind and cracks the skin.  
With nothing but sand for miles on end  
A dry heart is scattered with dust on the wind.


The look of loneliness is the tree on the plain  
that cries to be comforted against the rain.  
Standing alone for a thousand years  
Waiting for another to dry its tears.


The feel of loneliness is the sharpened knife  
That glints in the light of the darkest night.  
A blade that is waiting for nothing at all  
A mind that is fighting against the fall.
