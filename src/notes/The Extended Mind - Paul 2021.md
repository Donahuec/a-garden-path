## Introduction

### Prologue

- Society tends to view thinking as happening only *inside the brain*. This is  
  also known as a **brainbound** approach.
- **Extra-Neural Resources** not only *enhance* our thinking, but are *vital* to  
  it.
- **Embodied Cognition:** The impact of the body of thinking
- **Situated Cognition:** The impact of the environment on thinking
- **Distributed Cognition:** The impact of other people on thinking

### Introduction: Thinking Outside the Brain

-  We have historically viewed the brain as a biologically self-contained  
  entity that can be trained and improved, but modern society is hitting the  
  limits of it's biological capabilities. Instead we can look to *external  
  resources* to extend our thinking abilities
- Our brain's resources are far more limited than we tend to imply
- As technology advances, information proliferates, and life becomes more  
  fast-paces the demands on our brains are outpacing their capabilities.
- **Neurocentric Bias:** We are almost exclusively taught 'brainbound' thinking  
  skills, and not tools we can use beyond those limitations
- We have historical, cultural, and psychological beliefs and biases that say  
  that the brain is self contained and measurable.
  - Brains as computers processing inputs
  - Brains as muscles that can be trained
- We need a *new metaphor* that views brains as interconnected
  - Nesting magpies, weaving their nests from available materials

## Part 1: Thinking with Our Bodies

### Chapter 1: Thinking With Sensations

- **Interoception:** Awareness of the body and it's internal sensations
- We do not have the *conscious capacity* to process all of the inputs and  
  patterns we experience. But we do on a *subconscious level*, and our body  
  responds to these triggers
- Our bodies react to recognized patterns much faster than our conscious minds  
  can, if we even react consciously at all.
- Interoceptive response can *bypass cognitive biases*
- Interoception can also help us with *resilience* - allowing us to manage  
  energy use and stressors in a sustainable and healthy way
- Interoception also helps with empathy and understanding the emotional state of  
  others. We tend to unconsciously mimic the body language of others which can  
  trigger similar interoceptive sensations
- Emotions *start as physical sensations* that our brain *responds to and  
  categorizes*. By understanding and recognizing these sensations, we can start  
  to understand and better respond to them.

### Chapter 2: Thinking with Movement

- Physical movement can impact our thinking in different ways, depending on type  
  and intensity
- Maintaining stillness takes cognitive load and reduces cognitive ability.
  - Motion is our natural state
- **Small movements**, such as standing or fidgeting allows us to *regulate our  
  mental arousal* and improves executive function, processing, and focus.
- **Moderate physical activity**, such as walking, can *increase cognitive  
  abilities* and executive function *during it and for up to two hours after*
- **High intensity activity** *reduces cognitive ability* while active, but when  
  sustained can *trigger an altered mental state* called **transient  
  hypofrontality**. This state can increase creative and unexpected thinking
- Connecting movement cues to memory taps into a stronger form of memory than  
  visual or auditory cues
- **Enactment Effect:** Our recall of a memory if we use both  
  [[Procedural Memory]] and [[Declarative Memory]].
- **Kinesthetic Memory:** Movement based memory, strong and relatively  
  unconscious.
- There are **four major types of movement** to improve thinking
  - **Congruent Movement:** movement that represents the meaning of a concept,  
    like moving on a number line
  - **Novel Movement:** understanding a concept by performing it, such as  
    experiencing torque or centripetal force to understand both the physical and  
    conceptual meanings - it is harder for us to understand something we haven't  
    experienced
  - **Self-Referential Movement:** Reenacting a concept as if you are a part of  
    it. i.e. acting out planetary movements or cell reproduction
  - **Metaphorical Movement:** inducing a state of mind by enacting movements  
    related to established metaphors. i.e. 'thinking outside of the box,'  
    'spinning your wheels'
- Movement can help make *abstract concepts* more understandable, by giving them  
  a *concrete form*.

### Chapter 3: Thinking with Gesture

- Gesture can help make abstract concepts more concrete
  - Many of these methods of external thinking are to help make things concrete
- Gesture can *boost memory* with *physical cues*
- Gesture is our first language - both individually and evolutionarily
- Research shows that we often *communicate and understand* with gesture, before  
  we even consciously speak or understand
- Gesture *primes our speaking and understanding* on a primal, subconscious  
  level
- Gesture is a vital part of our processing and learning
  - We gesture more as we are working to understand a topic, the amount also  
    correlating the the complexity and difficulty of the topic
- Gesture can help to describe and understand topics that are difficult to  
  understand with words
  - Visual, spatial, relational, abstract
- Seeing gesture combined with speech *improves comprehension* of the listener
- The more *sensory cues* attached to a concept, *the more effective we are at  
  recall*. Gesture provides kinesthetic, spatial, visual, and proprioceptive  
  hooks
- Adding **sensorimotor cues** to words or vocabulary can improve recall and  
  understanding
  - Good for language learning!
- Adding sensory cues (movement, auditory, etc) activates the related portions  
  of the brain when recalling, offloading some of the work from the language  
  centers
  - "**Sensorimotor Enrichment**"

## Part 2: Thinking with Our Surroundings

### Chapter 4: Thinking with Natural Spaces

- Our bodies and minds evolved to function in largely outdoor environments
- The switch to primarily urban and indoor environments drains our mental  
  resources. In contrast, *nature has a restorative effect*
- Time in nature can reduce stress and negative thinking patterns, as well as  
  improve memory, focus, and working memory
- Time in nature may be helpful for depression and ADHD
- Our minds are attuned to the general visual traits of nature, and respond to  
  them
  - One example of this is people responding to fractal patterns similar to  
    those found in nature in a similar way to natural environments themselves
  - This means that we can replicate natural elements in our indoor environments  
    to positive effect
- We prefer environments that are visually abundant but also predictable,  
  repetitive, and redundant
- There is a measurable positive impact of nature on the body and brain, even  
  within 20-30 seconds
- Incorporating natural light, windows with natural views, and natural decor can  
  give us 'micro-restorative' visual breaks throughout the day.
- Exposure to natural scenery increases forward thinking, delayed gratification,  
  and reduces impulsivity
- Nature induces a state of "soft fascination", which improves creativity and  
  associative thinking
- Experiencing awe softens our mental models, leaving us open minded and  
  boosting creativity
- Awe is also shown to boost altruistic behavior
- What makes a natural space?
  - Abundant but predictable visual stimulation
    - repetitive (leaves, trees)
    - redundant (fractals, repeated elements)
    - coherent (few clashing transitions)
  - Curving shapes over straight lines
  - Densely clustered edges and elements
  - low hue variation, but high saturation
  - natural, diffuse light

### Chapter 5: Thinking with Built Spaces

- **Cathedral Effect:**  
  [[Cathedral Effect|Our environment affects how we think]]
- Open spaces increase collaboration, but also increase distraction and reduce  
  focus
  - We are tuned to focus on speech
  - We are tuned to notice movement and focus on faces
  - These distractions use the same cognitive resources as common work tasks,  
    reduce the ability to do them well
- We are empowered and have increased productivity and creativity when working  
  in spaces we feel we have ownership and control over: home turf advantage
- It is important to encourage both collaborative and private work spaces - each  
  are important for different phases of work
- We function best when we can include identity cues into our spaces
- We need to consider prejudice in our spaces, and who may feel excluded by them

### Chapter 6: Thinking with the Space of Ideas

- **"Method of Loci"** or **"Memory Place:** Strategy that attaches information  
  to memories of familiar places
  - engages hippocampus and more core navigational memory to improve  
    memorization
- Our hippocampus is central to physical navigation, but is also part of  
  organizing our thoughts and memories - mapping the abstract space of ideas
- We can 'offload' information on to physical space - using methods like  
  outlining and note-taking - to make it more concrete and easier to process
- **Concept Mapping** helps us better process and understand ideas
- Recording thoughts and observations has several benefits
  - concrete and specific in a way internal thoughts aren't
  - able to engage additional senses (i.e. visual)
  - a conversation with our ideas: emergent, and the act of separating them from  
    our minds opens new pathways and possibilities for interpretation
- We benefit from physical interaction with representations of our ideas and  
  thoughts

## Conclusion

## Additional Notes

> "The human brain is limited in its ability to pay attention, limited in its  
> capacity to remember, limited in its facility with abstract concepts, and  
> limited in its power to persist with a challenging task." (2)

> "Human beings [...] are born ready to learn certain things: how to speak the  
> language of the local community, how to find their way around a familiar  
> landscape, how to negotiate the challenges of small-group living. We are not  
> born to learn the intricacies of calculus or the counterintuitive rules of  
> physics; we did not evolve to understand the workings of the financial markets  
> or the complexities of global climate change. And yet we dwell in a world  
> where such biologically secondary capacities hold the key to advancement, even  
> survival. The demands of the modern environment have now met, and exceeded,  
> the limits of the biological brain" (12)

Rethink the idea of expert - those who know best how to learn the tools and  
resources of the trade, not those who have spent the most time on it

- Rings true in tech - technology outpaces our ability to learn about it.
- What does it mean to be an expert in computer/technology based roles?
- Old idea of 10,000 hours to master a skill - if you've spent that long on a  
  skill in tech, it is probably out of date

> "We extend beyond our limits, not by revving our brains like a machine or  
> bulking them up like a muscle - but by strewing our world with rich materials,  
> and weaving them into our thoughts" (17)

### Thinking with Sensations

Interoception can give us quicker and clearer access to our  
[[Intuition is internalized experience| intuition]]

- Body scans are a good way to improve interoception. Body scans are probably  
  the form of meditation I've done the most. Maybe this has contributed to my  
  good interoception?

- Is there a relationship between Neurodivergency and interoception? What about  
  sensory processing disorder?

- Can too much interoception tip over to the side of decreasing regulation and  
  causing overreaction? Overwhelming, over impulsive responses? The difference  
  between sensing and understanding internal responses? alexithymia and  
  interoception?

Interoception can respond more rationally than our conscious minds, bypassing  
biases like fairness, anchoring effect, availability heuristic, and self-serving  
bias

We don't always have time to consider [[Higher Order Thinking]], but relying on  
our instincts and intuition can often give us an advantage

- When we struggle to decide on something and use randomness to pick we often  
  then realize that we want the other option. Is forcing the decision triggering  
  our physical reaction of disappointment so that we can consciously recognize  
  what we want? We subconsciously knew the answer already.

We can use emotional reappraisal to recategorize physical-emotional responses  
into more positive emotions , like anxiety into excitement. This only works if  
the two emotions have congruent physical sensations.

- "Social Interoception", mimicking and internalizing others actions into our  
  own empathy. Could varied levels of interoception and recognition be related  
  to the varied levels of empathy on the Autism Spectrum?

### Thinking with Movement

Society tends to associate stillness with focus and productivity, when in  
reality allowing movement improves concentration, focus, confidence, and other  
mental faculties required for effective learning

The requirement of stillness is especially impactful on people with ADHD who use  
motion to regulate attention, but everyone benefits from movement when thinking  
(curb-cut effect)

> "Parents and teachers often believe that they have to get kids to stop moving  
> around before they can focus and get down to work, [...] the more productive  
> approach would be to allow kids to move around *so that* they can focus" (49)

Fidgeting is a powerful tool to calm anxiety, reduce tiredness, contemplate  
difficult topics, and regulate mental stimulation.

> "The social disapproval directed at fidgeting is misplaced. Though we imagine  
> that we can regulate our mental activity from within our heads, it's often  
> more effective to employ the movements of our bodies for that purpose - to  
> engage in [...] "embodied self-regulation"" (49)

Fidget toys also provide a medium for sensory regulation and integration

It is good to include bursts of moderate physical activity, like walking,  
throughout the day. I do miss coffee walks from working in person. Perhaps the  
loss of those also impacted my focus and attention?

### Thinking with Gesture

> "People formulate and convey their thoughts not only with words but also with  
> the motions of the hands and the rest of the body. Gestures don't merely echo  
> or amplify spoken language; they carry out cognitive and communicative  
> functions that language can't touch. Where language is discrete and linear -  
> one word following another - gesture is impressionistic and holistic,  
> conveying an immediate sense of how things look and feel and move" (69)

- Could the lack of gesture be part of why I struggle so much with digital  
  presenting? Could I improve this by including gesture, even when it won't be  
  seen? Gesture plays a strong role in my thinking and processing. Could the  
  damage I've taken to the speech centers of my brain play into this? I know I  
  rely on gesture a lot when I am struggling to communicate

> "Gesture can mentally prime a word so that the right term comes to our lips.  
> When people are prevented from gesturing, they talk less fluently; their  
> speech becomes halting because their hands are no longer able to supply them  
> with the next word, and the next." (72)

- Since gesture helps us process concepts, and we are more likely to gesture  
  when communicating with others, does this potentially give an additional  
  benefit of talking through problems with others?

- How much impact has video/remote communication and not being able to see  
  body/gesture based communication affected learning and comprehension during  
  COVID?

- If gestures can offload some of the capacity of our minds, is more effective  
  gesture use also able to improve working memory?

> "Hands can be a prompt, a window, a way station - but what they ought never  
> have to be is still" (88)

As someone with ADHD and Autism, that is such a fucking validating sentence to  
read
