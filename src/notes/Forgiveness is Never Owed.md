title: Forgiveness is never owed, only earned
---

- we don't owe anyone forgiveness, even if that is what society expects
- forgiving when you aren't ready is like putting a band aid over a wound that  
  needs stitches
- you can move on, and let go, but if someone hasn't earned your forgiveness,  
  you don't need to forgive them. It's a choice you can only make for yourself.
- Forgiving someone who hasn't done anything to earn it will only hurt more when  
  they repeat the same actions
- you don't have to let your hurt overwhelm you, or even your relationship with  
  the person either. Sometimes forgiveness where is isn't due could make things  
  worse. Foster resentment.
- Not forgiving is more realistic, as long as you can embrace it and let go
- Forgiveness is for someone else. Letting go is for yourself.
- I only forgive people who have shown me that they understand their mistakes  
  and work to make up for them. Apologies go a long way for this, but a change  
  in behavior is also necessary
- There is a difference between one-time mistakes vs. repeated long term  
  actions. It's easier to forgive a mistake, especially when it happens under  
  extenuating circumstances. It is much harder to forgive a choice, especially  
  one repeatedly made.
- I don't forgive dad for what he did when I was young. I don't think I ever  
  will - He's never done a thing to earn it. I have moved on though. And for the  
  most part I've let go.
